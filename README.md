# _E.coli-E.coli_ coculture for the production of BCA-derived MBE
## Interactive response surface plots
A Jupyter notebook is provided with the Python code to generate the plots using Plotly library.

### List of links to the response surface plots for BCA-derived MBE

Each plot is generated for the two depicted variables, fixing the third variable to its zero value.
